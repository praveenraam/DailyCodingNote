It is a build in Data Types

- An array is a data structure that can hold a collection of values
- Arrays can contain a mix of different data types. You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same array
- Arrays are resizable. You don't have to declare the size of an array before creating
it
- JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed and the insertion order is maintained
- Arrays are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop

#### Array - Big-O time complexity
- Insert / remove from end — O(1)
- Insert / remove from beginning – O(n)
- Access - 0(1)
- Search - O(n)
- Push / pop - O(1)
- Shift / unshift / concat / slice / splice - O(n)
- for Each / map / filter / reduce - O(n)
