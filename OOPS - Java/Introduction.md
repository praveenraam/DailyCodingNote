#### I'm Starting to learn oops concepts in java programming language using the You tube playlist by Kunal Kushwaha and taking notes.

#### [Link for the Youtube Playlist](https://youtu.be/BSVKUk58K6U?si=sz1hTbznRzNiqPwh) and referring [github repository](https://github.com/premnath018/oops_java)

We can create our own datatype

The variables used inside the classes are instance variable
