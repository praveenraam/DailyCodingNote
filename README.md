# Programming Notes

This is a repository for my daily programming learning notes and code snippets. I use Obsidian to take notes on concepts, technologies, and techniques I'm studying and want to remember. 

# Purpose

I created this repository to:

- Have all my programming notes in one central, organized place
- Track my progress in learning various programming skills  
- Reinforce concepts by revisiting and adding to the notes over time
- Reference back when I need a quick refresher or reminder on something

By keeping these updated notes on GitHub, I can access them from anywhere and leverage version control to track changes. I find taking these active notes helps me learn more effectively.


# Contents

The notes are organized by topics like:

- Programming languages (Java, JavaScript)
- Data structures and algorithms

I try to include code snippets directly in the notes when relevant.


# Feedbacks 

As this is intended mainly for my own use and sharing the knowledge across everybody. You can send you feedback and suggestions
