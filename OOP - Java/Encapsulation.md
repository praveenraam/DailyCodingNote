### Abstraction vs Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a implementation system and the abstraction is a design level system.

**Encapsulation** : Wrap up the code as a single entity and protect it from the outside world. Focuses on the Internal one.
**Abstraction** : Encapsulation did everything and I show you the essential ones for outside. Focuses on the external one.


### Data hiding vs Encapsulation

**Data Hiding** : Hiding of data that are not allowed to access using private is called Data Hiding
**Encapsulation** : Modification of the things that are private using getters and setters is Encapsulation.
