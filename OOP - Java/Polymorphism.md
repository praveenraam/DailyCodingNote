### What is polymorphism

Poly - Many
Morphism - way to represent

Representing of function in different ways is polymorphism.


### Types of polymorphism

##### Static / Compile time Polymorphism : 
This is achieved by method overloading.
This is also mentioned as ==early Binding==
###### What is method overloading?

It is when multiple methods with the same name exist with different parameters.
Ex : multiple constructors in class, we used box class for example.
- The return type of the methods should be same, they can't be different

The compile time polymorphism is named after java decides which method to run at the compile time. 

```Java
public class AdditionCalculator {

	public int sum(int a, int b,int c,int d){
		return a+b+c+d;
	}
	public int sum(int a,int b){
		return a+b;
	}
	public int sum(int a,int b,int c){
		return a+b+c;
	}
	public int sum(String a,int b){
		return Integer.parseInt(a)+b;
	}
	public int sum(int a,String b){
		return a+Integer.parseInt(b);
	}
	public double sum(double a,double b){
		return a+b;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		AdditionCalculator calc = new AdditionCalculator();
		int val1 = calc.sum(1,2);
		int val2 = calc.sum(2,4,2);
		int val3 = calc.sum(2,3,4,5,1); // This will give error.
	}
}
```

##### Run time / Dynamic Polymorphism

Achieved by overriding.

- The overriding is nothing but the same function with different body.
- This overriding is mention with the annotation.
- The method to call is decided in the run time. 
- If we used final in front of the method, it can't be overriding in the subclasses
- This is also mentioned as ==late binding==

Now we create a superclass Shapes and subclass Triangle, Circle and Square.

Shapes.java
```Java]
public class Shapes {  
    public void Area(){  
        System.out.println("The area for shapes");  
    }   
}
```

Triangle.java
```Java
public class Triangle extends Shapes{  
    public void Area(){  
        System.out.println("The area is 0.5*h*b");  
    }  
}
```

Circle.java
```Java
public class Circle extends Shapes{  
    public void Area(){  
        System.out.println("The area is pie*r*r");  
    }  
}
```
In this example, we call the same functions but it gave us output in different ways. Writing different constructors are also polymorphism's example.

Shapes.java
```Java]
public class Shapes {  
    public void Area(){  
        System.out.println("The area for shapes");  
    }   
}
```
Triangle.java
```Java
public class Triangle extends Shapes{ 
	@Override // These are overriding the function of superclass.
    public void Area(){  
        System.out.println("The area is 0.5*h*b");  
    }  
}
```
Circle.java
```Java
public class Circle extends Shapes{  
	@Override // These are overriding the function of superclass.
    public void Area(){  
        System.out.println("The area is pie*r*r");  
    }  
}
```
Square.java
```Java 
public class Square extends Shapes{  
    public void Area(){  
        System.out.println("The area is l*l");  
    }  
}
```

Ex 1 : Main.java
```Java
public class Main {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Shapes shape = new Shapes();  
        Circle circle = new Circle();  
        Square sqaure = new Square();  
        Triangle triangle = new Triangle();  
        
        shape.Area();     // The area for shapes  
        circle.Area();    // The area is pie*r*r
        sqaure.Area();    // The area is l*l
        triangle.Area();  // The area is 0.5*h*b
    }  
}
```

Ex 2 : Main.java
```Java
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Shape shape = new Shape();
		Shape circle = new Circle();
		Shape square = new Square();
		
		circle.Area(); // The output will be from the class Circle Area, because it is overriding from the parent class
	}
}
// Output : The area is pie*r*r
```

After overriding is done on a function, which Area to be called is depend on the object type, not the reference type. This is mentioned as ==**Upcasting**==. 

##### Override in static method
Static methods can't be override. 

``Box boxweight = new BoxWeight();``
Here the reference class is Box and obj class is BoxWeight, if we call a static method that is present in the both, it will call the reference class method and return the output.

**The method defined static can be inherited but can't be override.**

```Java
public class Box{
	public static void greet(){
		System.out.println("From Box");
	}
}
```

```Java
public class BoxWeight extends Box{
	public static void greet(){
		System.out.println("From BoxWeight");	
	}
}
```

Main.java
```Java
class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Box box = new Box();
		BoxWeight boxweight = new BoxWeight();
		
		box.greet(); // From Box 
		boxweight.greet(); // From BoxWeight
		
		// If there is no greet() in BoxWeight,
		boxweight.greet(); // From Box
	}
}
```

### Access modifier changes

While overriding the function, you can make the access modifier to visible more, can't make it less visible.

private -> public , default, protected
default -> public, protected
protected -> public
public can't be altered.

**Example 1** :``private void methodName`` is there, while overriding we can change to ``protected void methodname`` or ``public void methodName`` 

**Example 2** : ``protected void methodName`` can be changed to ``public void methodName``

##### How java decide which method to run in dynamic polymorphism

This is decided with dynamic programming dispatch.
