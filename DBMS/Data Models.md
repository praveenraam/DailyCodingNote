There 4 types of Data model.

### Relational Data Model
This type of model designs the data in the form of rows and columns within a table. Thus, a relational model uses tables for representing data and in-between relationships. Tables are also called relations.

### Entity Relationship Model (ER Model)
An ER model is the logical representation of data as objects and relationships among them.

### Object-based Data Model 
An extension of the ER model with notions of functions, encapsulation, and object identity, as well. This model supports a rich type system that includes structured and collection types.

### Semi structured Data Model : 
The semistructured data model allows the data specifications at places where the individual data items of the same type may have different attributes sets.
