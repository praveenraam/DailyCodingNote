## What is Prompt Engineering?

- This career rises after the growth of the AI in the recent World
- This also include the Writing , refine and optimizing the prompts
 
## What is AI 

- A human trained Machine learning model that give response as per the prompt give to it 
- It completely depend on by how it is trained 
- Example: Chat GPT - Text Based Bot , Mid Journey - Image based bot

#### Language Model :
 - Gathers information about Your question or prompt 
 - Analysis your prompt in by which order it is given and everything
 - It depend on the Data given by the Trainer (Machine learning)
 
### Text Embedding
In computer science ,  particularly in the realm of machines learning and natural language processing (NPL) , text embedding is a popular technique to represent textual information in a format that can be easily processed by algorithms, especially deep learning models.

## Chat GPT 

- Developed by the company OPEN AI in 2011
- GPT - Generative Pre-trained Transformer
- There are major 4 version released till the date 
- GPT 2 - 2019 : GPT 3 - 2020 : GPT 4 - 2023 (Paid Version)
- Interaction with Chat GPT is very easy

## Best Practices

##### Clear Instruction

- Clearing what you need 

**Example** :  When is the Election ? - **DONT**
When is the next Presidental Election in Poland ? - **DO**

- Ask for how you need and how the Answer Should be

**Example** : In case you need a code in JavaScript of sorting array

**DONT** : Give me code for sorting array
**DO** : Give me a program for sorting array and storing it in an another new array in JavaScript programming language.
##### Adopt a persona

- Make the AI Model as your require Person to make the answer more accurate
- Specify the Person about like how he should respond

**Example** : Request for poem

**DONT** : Write me a poem for my 14 year child homework
**DO** : Write a Poem as 14 year girl that she is writing it for her homework in the genre of Nature in the city that her English teacher asked. (If needed mention the writing style)
##### Specify the format

- Specifying how the answer format should be
- From the **Previous Example** : Specifying in how many lines the poem should be in and how many words a line should contain.

**Example** : Requesting summary for an essay 

**DONT** : Give me summary for the essay
**DO** : Give me a summary for the Essay in 10 bullet points not exceeding more than 15 words in line and at end give 500 words summary.

##### Avoid Leading answer


##### Limit the Scope


## Advance Prompting 

##### Zero Shot Prompting

- It is a way of querying models like GPT without any explicit training examples for task at hand
- Zero shot typically means that a model performs a TASK without seeing any example works
- **EXAMPLE** : Special event dates 

##### Few Shot Prompting
- Some times , Zero Shot prompt wont be enough for our Answers , we need a bit more training
- Providing the Model with some information and giving prompts may give us the Expected answers



## AI Hallucination

- An AI Hallucination is when a large language model (LLM) generates false information
- They produce un usual output when the training data's gone wrong
- **EXAMPLE** : Deep dream from google
- This also happens with the **Text** model.!
