**This statement is used to fetch only he specific number of Top row data**
- For this, we use different Syntax based on the SQL we work

### SYNTAX

##### SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:

```SQL
SELECT TOP (number|percentage) column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### MySQL Syntax

We use `LIMIT` to pick the top 
```SQL
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number; 
```

### Oracle 12

We use `FETCH` to pick the Top
```SQL
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name
FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;
```

### USING PERCENTAGE

### SQL Server 

```SQL
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENTAGE  * FROM customer
```

### MySQL Server

```SQL
SELECT * FROM customers
FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENTAGE ROWS ONLY;
```

### USING WHERE 

```SQL
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM table_name
WHERE country='Berlin'
```
