This statement is used as like a conditional (if) in programming languages, filters the data from the database

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='INDIA'
```

### Syntax

```SQL 
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Text Fields vs Numeric Fields

If you are comparing text, you need to use single quotes 
Incase of the numeric fields, it is not required

### AND and OR

The WHERE can have more than one condition, this can be written using AND operator

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='INDIA' AND CustomerName LIKE %ab;
```
#### Syntax

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND  condition2 AND condition3
```

This is how OR operator also can be also used

#### Combining the Both

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE country='Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE %G OR CustomerName LIKE %H)
```

Using of parenthesis will give you your expected result 


### NOT Operator

The `NOT` operator is a opposite operator result of the actual result

```SQL 
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'Spain'
```
The result in the List of Peoples who are from other country except the Spain

#### Syntax 

```SQL
SELECT col1, col2
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition
```
