The `DELETE` is used to remove data of a row from the table

### SYNTAX

```SQL
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

##### EXAMPLE

```SQL
DELETE FROM customer 
WHERE customerID = 10;
```

### CAUTION 

**Incase if you use `DELETE` without `WHERE`, then all the rows in the table will be deleted, the table remains the same**

```SQL
DELETE FROM customers 
```


### DELETING A TABLE

We use `DROP` for deleting a table from the Data Base

```SQL
DROP TABLE Customers
```
