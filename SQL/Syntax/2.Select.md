The main purpose of the select is to extract the data from the database,

``SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers`` This take the Customer Name and City from the customer table. 

## Syntax 

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2 ....
FROM table_name
```

**Incase if you need all the rows from the table u you can use `*` instead of mentioning the column name**


### DISTINCT 

This statement will return only the different values from the row

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT name, city
FROM table_name
```

### COUNT DISTINCT 

Using this return the number of distinct element in the column

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city) 
FROM table_name
```
