## Memory Management : 

The operating system manages the Main or Primary Memory (Both are same), it allocates and deallocates the memory for a when the process is terminated, it also ensure that the process doesn't consumes more memory

This main memory is easy to be accessed by the CPU

In multi tasking the OS decide which program is **granted access and for how much time**

Speed of the each memory :

## Processor Management

While the process of multi tasking, the OS decide which process is prioritized for the access of the Processor and time of access. This is **Process Scheduling**, will be read in further topic

Traffic controller monitors the status of the process

## File Management 

The OS keep manages the File and directories in the memory or storage, the OS maintains the file management activities

The OS keep the status of files or directories creation, copy, delete and transfer and them in an organized way

The security protection from the un authorized access for the files in some imp directories 

## User Interface or Command Interface

As the OS is the middle man between the Hardware and User

The user is interacted with the OS offered GUI or Command line Interface based on OS

Through that Interface, the user is using the OS and OS application

## Booting computer

The process of restarting or starting a computer is called booting 

There are two types 
- **Cold Booting** : It is turning of computer by turning the switch off and turning on
- **Warm Booting** : It is turning of the computer by using of the OS

## Security

The OS uses Password protection for the protection of data and control the accesses for the program and the files

- Protection against unauthorized access using login system
- Protection against intrusion using firewall
- Protection against the Malwares
- Displaying messages about the System vulnerability

## Control for the system performance

OS play a vital role in making the performance of the CPU effectively

The OS handles the crucial task of handling the process scheduling and also controls the Multi tasking processes

### Job accounting 

The OS keep track of the processes of how much time and resources it uses, also the user who uses it.
In multi tasking while the different programs runs simultaneously, it decide which user uses how much processor for how much time for each process  

### Error Detecting Aids

The OS have the System to monitor the error and mal functions in the Computer system

From time to time, it check for the external threats and any type of damage to the hardware. That displays several messages and alerts

### Performs basic Computer tasks

OS manages the various peripheral devices such as mouse, keyboard and printers. Most of the OS are plug and play. 
They auto recognize and configure it as per the need

## Network management

- Network communication : 
	 The OS manages the packages sent over the network for the seamless experience and also make sure it came safely
	 They are the traffic cops for the Network to talk each other
- Settings and Monitoring : 
	 OS sets the required setting that send the data
	 OS allows us to access the internet via Wi-Fi, Ethernet and keeps monitoring it
