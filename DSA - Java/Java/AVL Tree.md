## Explanation

- AVL Tree is non-Linear Data type where we store and fetch the data in time complexity of O(log N) in doing the Insertion , Search , Deletion
- AVL Tree can be an effective way of storing data , All the AVL Tree can be Red Black Tree but all the Red Black trees are not AVL Tree
- An AVL Tree can be constructed by Following the Binary Search Tree Format Algorithm
- But the Tree must be balanced which mean the difference between the left and right side depth must be within (-1,0,1) for each node 
- Else we need to do rotation for making it Balanced 
- There are Right Left , Left Right , Single Right or Single Left Rotation for making the Balance 

## Example : 

This is an Example for AVL Tree

Example for Unbalanced AVL Tree (An Unbalanced Tree can't be a AVL Tree)
