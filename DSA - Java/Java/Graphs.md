### Type of graphs

- Directed 
- Undirected

### Content : 

- Node or vertex that contains the number
- The line that connects vertex are edges 
- The edge without arrow is undirected, which mean it can travel to u->v and v->u
- The edges with arrow, which means it can only travel in arrowed direction

### Cyclic Graph 

- The graph that start with a node and end at the same node

- Here the undirected graph is cyclic (Cyclic Undirected Graph) and directed graph is not cyclic (Acyclic Directed Graph)

### Path : Contains a lot of node and each of them are reachable

- You can't make a node appears twice in a path
- You have to travel with the edges

### Degree : No of nodes that are attached to the node

- Total Degree of graph  = 2 twice of no of edges

### Directed Graph Degree : 
There are two degrees

- In Degree : The number of incoming edges go inside it 
- Out Degree : The number of out going edges

### Edge weights :

- The graph without weights is always consider having weight of 1 unit

The weight are the unit of the edges that connects, it is just act as the distance
