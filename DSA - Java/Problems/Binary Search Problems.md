### Problem 1 : Ceiling of a Number

##### Find : 
You need to return the target value index or if target doesn't found return the next greatest number index of the target value

The solution is very similar to the Binary Search coding , where you will return the ==Start value== instead of -1 incase if you fail to find the exact target value in the Array

##### Solution :
```
```

### Problem 2 : Floor of a Number
##### Find : 
You need to return the target value index or if target doesn't found return the next smaller number index of the target value

This solution is also similar to the Binary Search Coding , where you will return the ==End Value== instead of -1 incase if you fail to find the exact target value in the Array
